# ct_sm
CosmoTransitions model file for the Standard Model, including an example ipython notebook.

Given the physical Higgs mass and vev the model file computes the potential
parameters. All couplings are evaluated at the same scale using the 
included one-loop renormalization group equations. 

Two different ways of implementing the Daisy resummation at finite temperature are provided. 
They are compared in the sample notebook file.
